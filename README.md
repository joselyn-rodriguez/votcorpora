# VOT Corpora

This package collects a number of small VOT corpora from different sources:

* Baese-Berk & Goldrick (2009) experiment 1 measured voice onset time for
  monosyllabic words with word-initial voiceless stops. Some words had voiced
  minimal pair, while others did not. Words were read in isolation with other
  monosyllabic fillers that did not have initial stops. Experiment 1a only had
  /p/-initial words, and Experiment 1b had /t/ and /k/.

* Goldrick, Vaughn, & Murphy (2013), experiment 1 is analogous to Baese-Berk &
  Goldrick (2009) but with voiced stops.

* Lev-Ari, S., & Peperkamp, S. (2013). English-French bilinguals (English L1)
  read 16 sentences, 10 of which contained one word each starting with /p/, /t/,
  and /k/. (Items are the English sentences from Fowler, Sramkoc, Ostrya,
  Rowlanda, & Halle, 2008). A subset of the talkers also conducted interviews,
  from which VOTs of all word-initial voiceless stops were measured.

* Buckeye (Nelson, N. & Wedel, A., _under revision_). VOTs hand-annotated from word-initial
  voice and voiceless stops in the Buckeye Corpus of conversational speech by
  Andy Wedel and Noah Nelson.  Age is coded as old (40+) or young (under 40).
  Includes stop length and local speech rate information, but no pre-voiced
  tokens.

The first two are from isolated word list reading, the third from sentences and
conversational speech and the fourth from conversational speech. All are from
English monolinguals except for the Lev-Ari data, which is from L1 English, L2
French speakers who live in France and speak French primarily. The Buckeye,
Lev-Ari, and Goldrick et al. (2013) have speaker sex coded, and Buckeye and
Lev-Ari have age (Buckeye only as older/younger than 40).

__The only corpus that has both voiced and voiceless stops for each talker is the
Buckeye data.__
